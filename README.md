# SubItDownload
Small Chrome extension to ease the process of importing SubItUp shifts into calendar programs.
To add it to chrome just go to chrome://extensions, click developer mode, click 'load unpacked' and select the folder. Make sure you move the folder to your documents or somewhere safe so you don't accidentally delete it!! If you have any questions or there are any bugs please let me know! At the moment I have it set to only work when you are in the ‘week’ view of scheduling, as that is the view I’m most often in, considering we get our shifts by week.

Special thanks to Ilze Greever for helping me bug-fix
